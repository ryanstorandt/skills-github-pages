# Getting Started with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a powerful feature provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repositories. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to get started with GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A GitHub account
- A repository containing the static website files you want to host

## Step 1: Creating a Repository

If you don't have a repository yet, you can create one by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com) and sign in to your account.
2. Click on the "New" button to create a new repository.
3. Give your repository a name and choose the appropriate settings.
4. Click on the "Create repository" button to create the repository.

## Step 2: Enabling GitHub Pages

Once you have a repository, you can enable GitHub Pages by following these steps:

1. Go to your repository's settings page.
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
3. Select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (e.g., `main` or `master`).
4. Choose the folder where your website files are located (e.g., `/` for the root directory).
5. Click on the "Save" button to enable GitHub Pages.

## Step 3: Customizing Your Website

GitHub Pages allows you to customize your website by using different themes and adding custom domain names. Here are some options you can explore:

- **Themes**: GitHub Pages provides a variety of themes that you can choose from. To apply a theme, go to your repository's settings page and select the desired theme from the "GitHub Pages" section.
- **Custom Domain**: If you want to use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages website, you can configure it by following the instructions provided in the "Custom domain" section of your repository's settings page.

## Step 4: Publishing Your Website

Once you have enabled GitHub Pages and customized your website, you can publish it by following these steps:

1. Commit and push your website files to the branch you selected for GitHub Pages.
2. Wait for a few moments for GitHub to build and publish your website.
3. Visit your GitHub Pages website by navigating to `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>` in your web browser, where `<username>` is your GitHub username and `<repository>` is the name of your repository.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and published your website using GitHub Pages. Now you can share your website with others and continue to update and improve it as needed.

Remember to regularly commit and push your changes to keep your GitHub Pages website up to date.
